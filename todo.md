# TODOs for json schema generation

## Enums with (bit_flags) option
Not sure how to handle enums with bit_flags. Is it expected that in the json file is a number or should this be an string containing the enum value name?

## Include Jsonschema validation with python
Include Python test with [jsonschema](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/jsonschema)

## Handling of hash options

When this option is present in the json this field is expected to be a string.
